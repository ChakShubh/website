            Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, 
            melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. [1][2][3] Exact definitions of music vary considerably 
            around the world,[4] though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal.[5] While
            scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise 
            definitions.[6] The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, 
            and musical performance,[7] though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, 
            and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human 
            voice. In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, 
            in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure 
            and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while 
            sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each 
            performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated 
            electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events 
            such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or 
            soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 
            player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones. Music often plays a key role in social 
            activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The music 
            industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors 
            of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed 
            and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.
            The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s.[8] It is derived from a long line of 
            successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th 
            century; and the Latin mūsica.[9][10][n 1] The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké 
            (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses".[9][n 2] The Muses were nine deities
            in Ancient Greek Mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.[13][14] They were included in tales 
            by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,[15] and eventually came to be associated with music 
            specifically.[14] Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses.
            [11] The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via 
            spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the 
            Italian musica, German musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.[14]
            The modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term, used to describe diverse 
            genres, styles and traditions.[16] This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern 
            Indonesian (musik) and Shona (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, 
            as they did not have words that fit exactly the Western scope.[14] In East Asia, neither Japan or China 
            have a single word which encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally often regard music in 
            such a fashion.[17] The closest word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning 
            joy, and originally referred to all the arts before its narrowing in meaning.[17] Africa is too diverse 
            to make firm generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's 
            often inseparable connection to dance and speech in general.[18] Some African cultures, such as the 
            Songye people of the DRC and Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' 
            but no corresponding word in their native languages.[18] Other words commonly translated as 'music' 
            often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita 
            properly refers to art music,[19] while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words f
            or music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless.[20] Though the 
            Arabic musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while 
            khandan identifies vocal and improvised music.[21]. It is often debated as to what extent the origins 
            of music will ever be understood,[22] and there are many competing theories which aim to explain it.[23] 
            Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is 
            disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language.[24] A 
            similar source of contention surrounds whether music the intentional result of natural selection or 
            was a byproduct spandrel of evolution.[24] The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles 
            Darwin in 1871, who stated that music arose as form of sexual selection, perhaps via in mating calls.
            [25] Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other 
            sexual selection methods,[26] though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted 
            the theory.[27] Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving 
            long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion 
            or as a defence to scare of predators.[28] Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings 
            from paleolithic archaeology sites. Flutes are often discovered, carved from bones in which lateral 
            holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one end like the Japanese 
            shakuhachi.[citation needed] The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be 
            at least 40,000 years old, though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a 
            musical instrument or an object formed by animals.[29] Instruments such as the seven-holed flute 
            and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the 
            Indus Valley civilization archaeological sites.[30] India has one of the oldest musical traditions 
            in the world—references to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures 
            of the Hindu tradition.[31] The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments 
            was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BCE.

            Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain, 
            or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, 
            entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve 
            participants' physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, 
            through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as 
            individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or 
            consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting 
            to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others 
            provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged 
            in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games 
            in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Sport is generally recognised as 
            system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions 
            such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3] Other organisations, 
            such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification 
            as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as 
            mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as 
            bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five 
            non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,[4][5] and limits the number 
            of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1] Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or 
            customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 
            Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It 
            can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including 
            objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression. Records 
            of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced 
            or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, 
            with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through 
            broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to 
            the sport.According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to 
            $620 billion as of 2013.[6] The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while 
            association football is the most popular spectator sport. Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000 BC.[15] Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt.[16] Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of Zoorkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills.[17] Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting. The traditional South Asian sport of kabaddi has been played for thousands of years, potentially as a preparation for hunting. A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia.[19] Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought motorised transportation and increased leisure time, letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sports people should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition gender identity.[20]Technology plays an important part in modern sport. It is a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), and it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making. Sports science is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear. Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to wearable technology.[41] In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by FINA, as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.[42][43 The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. In Association football, goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.[44] The technology is not compulsory,[45] but was used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,[46] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada,[47] as well as in the Premier League from 2013–14,[48] and the Bundesliga from 2015–16.[49] In the NFL, a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays. The final decision rests with the referee.[50] A video referee (commonly known as a Television Match Official or TMO) can also use replays to help decision-making in rugby (both league and union).[51][52] In international cricket, an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision.[53][54] Since 2008, a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in ICC-run tournaments, and optionally in other matches.[53][55] Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review, including instant replays, Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and Real Time Snickometer.[56][57] Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions

            <h2 style="color:blueviolet;"><center><b> Dance </b></center></h2><br>
            dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself. Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other. Although the above broad definition covers all forms of the art, philosophers and critics throughout history have suggested different definitions of dance that have amounted to little more than descriptions of the kind of dance with which each writer was most familiar. Thus, Aristotle’s statement in the Poetics that dance is rhythmic movement whose purpose is “to represent men’s characters as well as what they do and suffer” refers to the central role that dance played in classical Greek theatre, where the chorus through its movements reenacted the themes of the drama during lyric interludes. The English ballet master John Weaver, writing in 1721, argued on the other hand that “Dancing is an elegant, and regular movement, harmoniously composed of beautiful Attitudes, and contrasted graceful Posture of the Body, and parts thereof.” Weaver’s description reflects very clearly the kind of dignified and courtly movement that characterized the ballet of his time, with its highly formalized aesthetics and lack of forceful emotion. The 19th-century French dance historian Gaston Vuillier also emphasized the qualities of grace, harmony, and beauty, distinguishing “true” dance from the supposedly crude and spontaneous movements of early man: John Martin, the 20th-century dance critic, almost ignored the formal aspect of dance in emphasizing its role as a physical expression of inner emotion. In doing so, he betrayed his own sympathy toward the Expressionist school of modern American dance: “At the root of all these varied manifestations of dancing . . . lies the common impulse to resort to movement to externalise states which we cannot externalise by rational means. This is basic dance.”. A truly universal definition of dance must, therefore, return to the fundamental principle that dance is an art form or activity that utilizes the body and the range of movement of which the body is capable. Unlike the movements performed in everyday living, dance movements are not directly related to work, travel, or survival. Dance may, of course, be made up of movements associated with these activities, as in the work dances common to many cultures, and it may even accompany such activities. But even in the most practical dances, movements that make up the dance are not reducible to those of straightforward labour; rather, they involve some extra qualities such as self-expression, aesthetic pleasure, and entertainment. This article discusses the techniques and components of dance as well as the aesthetic principles behind its appreciation as an art. Various types of dance are discussed with emphasis on their style and choreography. The history of dance in various regions is treated in a number of articles; see dance, African; music and dance, Oceanic; dance, Western; arts, Central Asian; arts, East Asian; arts, Islamic; dance, Native American; arts, South Asian; and arts, Southeast Asian. The interaction between dance and other art forms is discussed in folk dance. One of the most basic motives of dance is the expression and communication of emotion. People—and even certain animals—often dance as a way of releasing powerful feelings, such as sudden accesses of high spirits, joy, impatience, or anger. These motive forces can be seen not only in the spontaneous skipping, stamping, and jumping movements often performed in moments of intense emotion, but also in the more formalized movements of “set” dances, such as tribal war dances or festive folk dances. Here the dance helps to generate emotions as well as release them.People also dance for the pleasure of experiencing the body and the surrounding environment in new and special ways. Dance often involves movement being taken to an extreme, with, for example, the arms being flung or stretched out, the head lifted back, and the body arched or twisted. Also, it often involves a special effort or stylization, such as high kicks, leaps, or measured walks. Dance movements tend to be organized into a spatial or rhythmic pattern, tracing lines or circles on the ground, following a certain order of steps, or conforming to a pattern of regular accents or stresses. All of these characteristics may produce a state of mind and body that is very different from that of everyday experience. The dance requires unaccustomed patterns of muscular exertion and relaxation as well as an unusually intense or sustained expenditure of energy. The dancer may become intensely aware of the force of gravity and of a state of equilibrium or disequilibrium that normal activities do not generate. At the same time, the dance creates a very different perception of time and space for the dancer: time is marked by the rhythmic ordering of movement and by the duration of the dance, and space is organized around the paths along which the dancer travels or around the shapes made by the body. Dance can, in fact, create a completely self-contained world for dancers, in which they are capable of physical effort, prowess, and endurance far beyond their normal powers. Sufi dervishes, as an extreme example, can whirl ecstatically for long stretches of time without appearing tired or giddy, and certain Indonesian dancers can strike daggers against their naked chests without causing apparent pain or injury. This transcendence of the everyday may also be experienced by the spectators. Drawn into the rhythms and patterns created by the dancer’s movements, they may begin to share in the emotions being expressed through them. They may also experience kinesthetically something similar to the physical sensations of the dancer. Kinesthesia, or the awareness of the body through sensations in the joints, muscles, and tendons, rather than through visual perception, not only defines the dancer’s experience of his or her own body in movement but also the way in which dance exerts its power over the spectators, who not only see it but also feel an echo of the dancer’s movements and rhythms in their own nerve endings.

            <h2 style="color:blueviolet;"><center><b> Yoga </b></center></h2><br>
            Yoga (/ˈjoʊɡə/ (listen);[1] Sanskrit: योग, lit. 'yoke' or 'union' pronounced [joːɡɐ]) is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke) and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the mind (Chitta) and mundane suffering (Duḥkha). There is a wide variety of schools of yoga, practices, and goals[2] in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism,[3][4][5] and traditional and modern yoga is practiced worldwide.[6] Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga originated in the Vedic period, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; according to author Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of non-Vedic and Vedic elements; this model is favoured in Western scholarship.[7][8] Yoga-like practices are first mentioned in the Rigveda.[9] Yoga is referred to in a number of the Upanishads.[10][11][12] The first known appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning as the modern term is in the Katha Upanishad,[13][14] which was probably composed between the fifth and third centuries BCE.[15][16] Yoga continued to develop as a systematic study and practice during the fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements.[17] The most comprehensive text on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, date to the early centuries of the Common Era;[18][19][note 1] Yoga philosophy became known as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools (Darśanas) of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.[20][web 1] Hatha yoga texts began to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in tantra.[21][22] The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga and a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique,[23] consisting largely of asanas;[24] this differs from traditional yoga, which focuses on meditation and release from worldly attachments.[23][25] It was introduced by gurus from India after the success of Swami Vivekananda's adaptation of yoga without asanas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[26] Vivekananda introduced the Yoga Sutras to the West, and they became prominent after the 20th-century success of hatha yoga. The Sanskrit noun योग yoga is derived from the root yuj (युज्) "to attach, join, harness, yoke".[28] Yoga is a cognate of the English word "yoke".[29] According to Mikel Burley, the first use of the root of the word "yoga" is in hymn 5.81.1 of the Rigveda, a dedication to the rising Sun-god, where it has been interpreted as "yoke" or "control".[30][31][note 2] Pāṇini (4th c. BCE) wrote that the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots: yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau ("to concentrate").[33] In the context of the Yoga Sutras, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is considered the correct etymology by traditional commentators.[34] In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa (who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras)[35] says that yoga means samadhi (concentration).[36] In the Yoga Sutras (2.1), kriyāyoga is yoga's "practical" aspect: the "union with the supreme" in the performance of everyday duties.[37] A person who practices yoga, or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment, is called a yogi; a female yogi may also be known as a yogini.[38]. The ultimate goals of yoga are stilling the mind and gaining insight, resting in detached awareness, and liberation (Moksha) from saṃsāra and duḥkha: a process (or discipline) leading to unity (Aikyam) with the divine (Brahman) or with one's Self (Ātman).[56] This goal varies by philosophical or theological system. In the classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve samadhi and remain in that state as pure awareness. According to Knut A. Jacobsen, yoga has five principal meanings:[57]
            A disciplined method for attaining a goal Techniques of controlling the body and mind A name of a school or system of philosophy (darśana) The goal of Yoga practice[58] David Gordon White writes that yoga's core principles were more or less in place in the 5th century CE, and variations of the principles developed over time:[59] A meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it to release any suffering, find inner peace, and salvation. Illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras, in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts.[60] The raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything. These are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its epic Mahābhārata, the Jain Praśamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts.[61] A path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive, delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality. Examples of this are found in Hinduism Nyaya and Vaisesika school texts as well as Buddhism Mādhyamaka texts, but in different ways.[62] A technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other supernatural accomplishments. These are, states White, described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta.[63] James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.[64] According to White, the last principle relates to legendary goals of yoga practice; it differs from yoga's practical goals in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools.[65] There is no consensus on yoga's chronology or origins other than its development in ancient India. There are two broad theories explaining the origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga has Vedic origins (as reflected in Vedic texts), and influenced Buddhism. This model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars.[66] According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of indigenous, non-Vedic practices with Vedic elements. This model is favoured in Western scholarship.[67] Speculations about yoga began to emerge in the early Upanishads of the first half of the first millennium BCE, with expositions also appearing in Jain and Buddhist texts c. 500 – c. 200 BCE. Between 200 BCE and 500 CE, traditions of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophy were taking shape; teachings were collected as sutras, and a philosophical system of Patanjaliyogasastra began to emerge.[68] The Middle Ages saw the development of a number of yoga satellite traditions. It and other aspects of Indian philosophy came to the attention of the educated Western public during the mid-19th century. According to Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, Hindu researchers have favoured a linear theory which attempts "to interpret the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis";[69][note 3] traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas as the source of all spiritual knowledge.[71][note 4] Edwin Bryant wrote that authors who support Indigenous Aryanism also tend to support the linear model.[74] Heinrich Zimmer was an exponent of the synthesis model,[71] arguing for non-Vedic eastern states of India.[75] According to Zimmer, Yoga is part of a non-Vedic system which includes the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, Jainism and Buddhism:[75] "[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India [Bihar] – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems."[76][note 5] Richard Gombrich[79] and Geoffrey Samuel[80] believe that the śramaṇa movement originated in non-Vedic Greater Magadha.[79][80] Thomas McEvilley favors a composite model in which a pre-Aryan yoga prototype existed in the pre-Vedic period and was refined during the Vedic period.[81] According to Gavin D. Flood, the Upanishads differ fundamentally from the Vedic ritual tradition and indicate non-Vedic influences.[82] However, the traditions may be connected: [T]his dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.[83][note 6] The ascetic traditions of the eastern Ganges plain are thought to drew from a common body of practices and philosophies,[85][86][87] with proto-samkhya concepts of purusha and prakriti as a common denominator.[88][87] The twentieth-century scholars Karel Werner, Thomas McEvilley, and Mircea Eliade believe that the central figure of the Pashupati seal is in a Mulabandhasana posture,[13] and the roots of yoga are in the Indus Valley civilisation.[89] This is rejected by more recent scholarship; for example, Geoffrey Samuel, Andrea R. Jain, and Wendy Doniger describe the identification as speculative; the meaning of the figure will remain unknown until Harappan script is deciphered, and the roots of yoga cannot be linked to the IVC.[89][90][note 7] The Vedas, the only texts preserved from the early Vedic period and codified between c. 1200 and 900 BCE, contain references to yogic practices primarily related to ascetics outside, or on the fringes of Brahmanism.[93][9] The Rigveda's Nasadiya Sukta suggests an early Brahmanic contemplative tradition.[note 8] Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and in the Brahmanas (the second layer of the Vedas, composed c. 1000–800 BCE).[93][96][97] According to Flood, "The Samhitas [the mantras of the Vedas] contain some references ... to ascetics, namely the Munis or Keśins and the Vratyas."[98] Werner wrote in 1977 that the Rigveda does not describe yoga, and there is little evidence of practices.[9] The earliest description of "an outsider who does not belong to the Brahminic establishment" is found in the Keśin hymn 10.136, the Rigveda's youngest book, which was codified around 1000 BCE.[9] Werner wrote that there were individuals who were active outside the trend of Vedic mythological creativity and the Brahminic religious orthodoxy and therefore little evidence of their existence, practices and achievements has survived. And such evidence as is available in the Vedas themselves is scanty and indirect. Nevertheless the indirect evidence is strong enough not to allow any doubt about the existence of spiritually highly advanced wanderers.[9] According to Whicher (1998), scholarship frequently fails to see the connection between the contemplative practices of the rishis and later yoga practices: "The proto-Yoga of the Vedic rishis is an early form of sacrificial mysticism and contains many elements characteristic of later Yoga that include: concentration, meditative observation, ascetic forms of practice (tapas), breath control practiced in conjunction with the recitation of sacred hymns during the ritual, the notion of self-sacrifice, impeccably accurate recitation of sacred words (prefiguring mantra-yoga), mystical experience, and the engagement with a reality far greater than our psychological identity or the ego."[99] Jacobsen wrote in 2018, "Bodily postures are closely related to the tradition of (tapas), ascetic practices in the Vedic tradition"; ascetic practices used by Vedic priests "in their preparations for the performance of the sacrifice" may be precursors of yoga.[93] "The ecstatic practice of enigmatic longhaired muni in Rgveda 10.136 and the ascetic performance of the vratya-s in the Atharvaveda outside of or on the fringe of the Brahmanical ritual order, have probably contributed more to the ascetic practices of yoga."[93] According to Bryant, practices recognizable as classical yoga first appear in the Upanishads (composed during the late Vedic period).[85] Alexander Wynne agrees that formless, elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition.[100] An early reference to meditation is made in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), one of the Principal Upanishads.[98] The Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE) describes the five vital energies (prana), and concepts of later yoga traditions (such as blood vessels and an internal sound) are also described in this upanishad.[101] The practice of pranayama (focusing on the breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,[102] and pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad.[102][note 9] The Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana (probably before the 6th c. BCE) teaches breath control and repetition of a mantra.[104] The 6th-c. BCE Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.[105] According to Flood, "[T]he actual term yoga first appears in the Katha Upanishad,[14] dated to the fifth[106] to first centuries BCE.[107]
