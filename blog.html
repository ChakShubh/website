            <p>Music</p>
            Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, 
            melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. [1][2][3] Exact definitions of music vary considerably 
            around the world,[4] though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal.[5] While
            scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise 
            definitions.[6] The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, 
            and musical performance,[7] though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, 
            and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human 
            voice. In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, 
            in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure 
            and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while 
            sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each 
            performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated 
            electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events 
            such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or 
            soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 
            player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones. Music often plays a key role in social 
            activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The music 
            industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors 
            of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed 
            and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.
            The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s.[8] It is derived from a long line of 
            successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th 
            century; and the Latin mūsica.[9][10][n 1] The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké 
            (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses".[9][n 2] The Muses were nine deities
            in Ancient Greek Mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.[13][14] They were included in tales 
            by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,[15] and eventually came to be associated with music 
            specifically.[14] Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses.
            [11] The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via 
            spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the 
            Italian musica, German musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.[14]
            The modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term, used to describe diverse 
            genres, styles and traditions.[16] This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern 
            Indonesian (musik) and Shona (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, 
            as they did not have words that fit exactly the Western scope.[14] In East Asia, neither Japan or China 
            have a single word which encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally often regard music in 
            such a fashion.[17] The closest word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning 
            joy, and originally referred to all the arts before its narrowing in meaning.[17] Africa is too diverse 
            to make firm generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's 
            often inseparable connection to dance and speech in general.[18] Some African cultures, such as the 
            Songye people of the DRC and Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' 
            but no corresponding word in their native languages.[18] Other words commonly translated as 'music' 
            often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita 
            properly refers to art music,[19] while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words f
            or music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless.[20] Though the 
            Arabic musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while 
            khandan identifies vocal and improvised music.[21]. It is often debated as to what extent the origins 
            of music will ever be understood,[22] and there are many competing theories which aim to explain it.[23] 
            Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is 
            disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language.[24] A 
            similar source of contention surrounds whether music the intentional result of natural selection or 
            was a byproduct spandrel of evolution.[24] The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles 
            Darwin in 1871, who stated that music arose as form of sexual selection, perhaps via in mating calls.
            [25] Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other 
            sexual selection methods,[26] though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted 
            the theory.[27] Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving 
            long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion 
            or as a defence to scare of predators.[28] Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings 
            from paleolithic archaeology sites. Flutes are often discovered, carved from bones in which lateral 
            holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one end like the Japanese 
            shakuhachi.[citation needed] The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be 
            at least 40,000 years old, though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a 
            musical instrument or an object formed by animals.[29] Instruments such as the seven-holed flute 
            and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the 
            Indus Valley civilization archaeological sites.[30] India has one of the oldest musical traditions 
            in the world—references to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures 
            of the Hindu tradition.[31] The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments 
            was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BCE.

            <p>Sports</p>
            Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain, 
            or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, 
            entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve 
            participants' physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, 
            through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as 
            individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or 
            consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting 
            to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others 
            provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged 
            in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games 
            in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Sport is generally recognised as 
            system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions 
            such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3] Other organisations, 
            such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification 
            as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as 
            mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as 
            bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five 
            non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,[4][5] and limits the number 
            of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1] Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or 
            customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 
            Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It 
            can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including 
            objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression. Records 
            of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced 
            or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, 
            with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through 
            broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to 
            the sport.According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to 
            $620 billion as of 2013.[6] The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while 
            association football is the most popular spectator sport.
